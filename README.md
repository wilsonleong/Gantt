## Problem Statement
As a Product Owner, I constantly need to produce slightly different versions of roadmap / project status update to my stakeholders. There is no free tool on the market that helps me plot a Gantt chart to visualise the backlog.

## Solution
This script generates a Gantt chart for timelines and roadmapping based on the list of issues (e.g. export from JIRA)
* Visualise my management data
* Automate my project scheduling
* Craft neat high-level agile roadmaps
