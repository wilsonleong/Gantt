## Problem Statement
As a Product Owner, I constantly need to produce the most updated roadmap as well as backlog / project status update. There is no free tool on the market that helps me plot a Gantt chart to visualise & communicate my product roadmap (strategic, high level) and backlog (details).

## Solution
This script generates a Gantt chart for timelines and roadmapping based on the list of issues (e.g. export from JIRA)
* Visualise my management data
* Automate my project scheduling
* Craft neat high-level agile roadmaps
